This is important time in their life because how they will grow and learn depends on the behaviours that you (and other adults) show to your child.<br>\u2022 The brain is developing very fast at this time and what happens to the child – love, play, care, nutrition and health – affects how the brain develops. Therefore in the coming weeks and months, we will continue doing what we will do today: talking about your child's behavior and development and conducting activities corresponding to your child's age. The goal is for you to continue doing these activities with a child.",
