Feed this to baby often and in small amounts, making sure baby can swallow it.\n\nWait until the baby's mouth is opened wide\n\nMove the baby quickly onto her breast, aiming the infant's lower lip will below the nipple.\n\nIf breast engorgement, express a small amount of breast milk before starting breastfeeding to soften nipple area so that it is easier for the baby to attach.",
